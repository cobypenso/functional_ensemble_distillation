# giung2

## Getting Started

* See [`scripts/example.ipynb`](scripts/example.ipynb) to learn about basic usage.
* See [`projects/`](projects/) for some research projects that are built on giung2. [`projects/CIFAR-Baselines/`](projects/CIFAR-Baselines/) will be a good start point to develop your own project.
